## Motivation

::: {.incremental}
- Sex^["What sex you were assigned at birth?"] differences ($M>F$) in vision [@Shaqiri2018-ys]: especially contrast sensitivity [@Abramov2012-da], motion sensitivity [@Murray2018-vn; @Qian2021-eu].
- Sex differences spatial cognition (e.g., mental rotation) and activity choices.
- Do these replicate?
- Do they relate to one another?

## Lessons learned

::: {.incremental}

- Replications are good
    - And sadly uncommon
    - Bigger (combined) samples $\rightarrow$ higher power to detect smaller effects
    - Don't we want to know the distribution of effect sizes | manipulations X, Y, Z?

:::

## Lessons learned

::: {.incremental}
- Data sharing is good
    - Didn't ask original authors for data, but shouldn't have to.
    - Most authors don't share even when asked [@Watson2022-ox; @Gabelica2022-nt; @Tedersoo2021-ad; @Vanpaemel2015-zr; @Wicherts2006-de] **even by a journal editor!** [@Miyakawa2020-wu].
:::

## Lessons learned

::: {.incremental}
- Preregistration helps draw bright line between *confirmatory* and *exploratory* analyses
    - Hard, but useful discipline
    - Included several post-registration exploratory analyses, including one suggested by reviewer.
    - "Causal" analysis: Vision better predictor of mental rotation scores than sex.
:::

## Lessons learned

- [Power *curve* analyses](https://gilmore-lab.github.io/sex-differences-project/analysis/preregistration/preregistration_power_analysis.html) (different $n$'s, effect sizes) especially informative and useful.

---

![Power analysis curves from [@Qian2022-yp]](include/img/qian-berenbaum-gilmore-power-plot.png){fig-align="center"}

---

- Don't fully understand relationship between sample size, power, and effect size? 
    - See [this exercise](https://psu-psychology.github.io/psych-490-reproducibility-2023-fall/ex05-apes.html) and [this app](https://rogilmore.shinyapps.io/PSYCH490-2023-APES/).
    
## Lessons learned
    
- We need bigger samples...
    
>...Assuming a realistic range of prior probabilities for null hypotheses, **false report probability is likely to exceed 50% for the whole (psychology and cognitive neuroscience) literature**. [@Szucs2017-fc]

## Lessons learned

::: {.incremental}
- Internally reproducible workflows
    - Bolster confidence ("don't fool yourself")
    - Easier to share with collaborators, the world
    - Always in a "share-able" form
    - Especially scriptable figures!

## Gilmore's additions...

- You *can* learn to code (and *should*), but do so in the context of solving a specific problem you care about
    - [Quarto Qrew](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/quarto-qrew/)
- Strive for *methods* reproducibility [@Goodman2016-fi] in your own projects
     
## *Methods* reproducibility

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

>Methods reproducibility refers to the provision of enough detail about study procedures and data so the same procedures could, in theory or in actuality, be exactly repeated.

- Does a typical journal article satisfy this?
- Does project X from your lab group satisfy this?
- Reproducible to your team $\rightarrow$ reproducible to others

- Greater openness $\rightarrow$ closer match between idealistic values and practical concerns
- Balance scientific norms [@Merton1973-vf] with counter-norms [@Mitroff1974-pp]

## What about the *other* crises?

::: {.incremental}
- Speed vs. accuracy, quantity vs. quality
- Avoiding cognitive biases in our own work [e.g., @munafo_manifesto_2017]
- $\Phi\leftarrow\Psi_{internal}$? That's another talk
