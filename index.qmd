## What the *actual* *F*-test?

## Crisis #2

::: {.incremental}
- What are we talking about?
- Psychology a science of behavior and internal experience (perception, cognition, emotion...)
- What is the logical, *physical* status of psychological states?
- If they can't be measured directly
    - And they can't
    - They really can't

## Internal $\psi$ states not observable, but...

- Behaviors are!

## Images and video are essential to the study of *behavior*

## Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY)

- What do mothers and their infants actually **do** when they are together at home?
- $n=$ 1,000 dyads
- 30+ sites
- 12, 18-, & 24-month-olds
- 1 hr natural behavior; video home tour; video-recorded survey questionnaires
- All openly shared on [Databrary.org](https://databrary.org)

---

- Full protocol and coding manual shared openly: <https://play-project.org>
- R Markdown-based project status site: <https://play-behaviorome.github.io/KoBoToolbox/>
- Novel curation strategies that reduce *post hoc* burden [@Soska2021-mh]
- Extensive (and open) quality assurance protocols [@Soska2021-mh]

- R Markdown-based project status site: <https://play-behaviorome.github.io/KoBoToolbox/>
- Embed cleaning & simple visualizations into ongoing workflow
- Data are (nearly) always in a share-able form

---

## Building the future... 

- [Databrary.org](https://databrary.org) data library
    - Video + other identifiable/sensitive data
    - Share openly, but not publicly, with restricted audience of researchers
    - Share with explicit participant/parent permission
- Scriptable (==reproducible) workflows via the Databrary API and the [*databraryr* package](https://github.com/databrary/databraryr/)

---

```{r echo=TRUE}
databraryr::login_db(Sys.getenv("DATABRARY_LOGIN"))
df <- databraryr::download_session_csv(vol_id = 4) |> 
  readr::read_csv()
xtabs(~ `participant-gender` + `participant-race`, df)
